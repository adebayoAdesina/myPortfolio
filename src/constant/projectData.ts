            At GeeCore Limited, I played a key role 
            in designing and developing the main page 
            and user dashboard for Wivali, an AI-powered 
            website builder. The main page showcases the platform's 
            innovative features, including AI-driven customization, 
            seamless payment integration, and advanced SEO tools. 
            The user dashboard provides an intuitive interface 
            for managing website content, tracking performance 
            metrics, and accessing various tools. I collaborated 
            closely with other developers to ensure a cohesive and 
            user-friendly experience across the platform.
